In my development I have chosen to use PHP. MYSQL AND HTML.
I use html and php to display and capture the data from the user input.
I send this data to the database using MYSQL and perform CRUD operations.


I chose this frameworks because they are quick to build with and get the product to market while still being functional and user friendly.
PHP is fast and can easily be hooked up to different apis. It is easy to consume apis and add endpoints.
